Okay, let's break down the steps required to perform the demo described in the sources for Cloud Cost Optimization using a Lambda function and Boto3 to delete stale EBS snapshots.

Here are the steps, drawing directly from the information provided:

1.  **Prerequisite: Have an AWS Account and Access the Console**
    *   You need an AWS account.
    *   Log in to your AWS Management Console.

2.  **Create the Resources That Will Become Stale**
    *   Go to the **EC2 dashboard** in the AWS console.
    *   Launch an **EC2 instance**.
        *   Give it a name (e.g., "test ec2 instance").
        *   Select an AMI (e.g., Ubuntu) and instance type (e.g., T2 micro).
        *   Choose or create a key pair.
        *   Keep the default attached volume.
        *   Launch the instance.
    *   Wait for the instance to be in a **running state**.
    *   Identify the **Volume ID** attached to this instance. You can find this in the storage tab of the instance details.
    *   Go to the **Snapshots** section under EBS in the EC2 dashboard.
    *   Click **"Create snapshot"**.
    *   Select the **Volume ID** you identified in the previous step.
    *   Give the snapshot a name (e.g., "test snapshot").
    *   Click "Create snapshot".
    *   The snapshot status will initially show as pending but should get created quickly.

3.  **Create the AWS Lambda Function**
    *   Go to the **Lambda** service in the AWS console.
    *   Click **"Create a function"**.
    *   Select **"Author from scratch"**.
    *   Give your function a name (e.g., "cost optimization EBS snapshot").
    *   Choose **Python** as the Runtime.
    *   Under "Change default execution role", keep the default option to **"Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions"**. You will 
        update permissions later.
    *   Click **"Create function"**.

4.  **Add the Python Code to the Lambda Function**
    *   Once the function is created, you will see the code editor area.
    *   Go to the source's GitHub repository and find the Python code for EBS stale snapshots (`EBS_stale_snapshots.py`).
    *   **Copy the entire code** from that file.
    *   Paste the copied code into the **Lambda function's code editor**, replacing the default code that was there.
    *   Click the **"Deploy"** button to save the code.

5.  **Configure Lambda Timeout and Permissions**
    *   **Increase the function timeout:**
        *   Go to the **"Configuration"** tab of your Lambda function.
        *   Click **"General configuration"** and then click **"Edit"**.
        *   Find the **"Timeout"** setting. The default is 3 seconds.
        *   Change it to a higher value, such as 10 seconds.
        *   Click **"Save"**.
    *   **Grant necessary IAM permissions:** The Lambda function needs permissions to interact with EC2 to list and delete snapshots and 
           volumes.
        *   Go back to the **"Configuration"** tab and click on **"Permissions"**.
        *   Click on the **"Execution role"** name. This will open the IAM console page for the role created for your Lambda function.
        *   On the role's page, click **"Add permissions"** and then **"Attach policies"**.
        *   You need to grant permissions for `ec2:DescribeSnapshots`, `ec2:DeleteSnapshot`, `ec2:DescribeVolumes`, and 
            `ec2:DescribeInstances`.
        *   Since these might not be in standard policies, you might need to **create a custom policy**:
            *   (Optional) Open a new tab and go to the IAM service -> Policies -> Create policy.
            *   Choose the **EC2 service**.
            *   Under "Actions", select the required permissions: **`DescribeSnapshots`**, **`DeleteSnapshot`**, **`DescribeVolumes`**, 
                **`DescribeInstances`**.
            *   Under "Resources", select **"All resources"** for simplicity in the demo.
            *   Click "Next" and provide a **name** for the policy (e.g., "CostOptimizationEBS").
            *   Click "Create policy".
        *   Go back to the Lambda execution role page.
        *   Click **"Add permissions"** -> **"Attach policies"** again.
        *   Search for the custom policy you just created ("CostOptimizationEBS").
        *   Select the policy and click **"Add permissions"**.

6.  **Test the Lambda Function (Before Deleting Resources)**
    *   Go back to your Lambda function's code tab.
    *   Click the **"Test"** button.
    *   If this is the first time testing, configure a test event. Give it any name (e.g., "test") and keep the default JSON content. 
         Click **"Save"**.
    *   Click the **"Test"** button again.
    *   The function should execute successfully now that permissions are granted.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The function should *not* delete the snapshot at this stage because the EC2 instance and its volume still 
       exist.
    *   **Verification:** Go back to the EC2 Snapshots dashboard and **refresh the page**. Confirm that the "test snapshot" is still 
       present.

7.  **Make the Resources Stale (Delete the Instance and Volume)**
    *   Go back to the **EC2 dashboard**.
    *   Find the "test ec2 instance" you created.
    *   **Terminate** the instance.
    *   Terminating the EC2 instance typically also deletes the volume it was attached to if it was the root volume.
    *   **Verification:** Verify in the EC2 console that the instance is terminated and its associated volume is also gone. Crucially, 
         verify that the "test snapshot" you created **still exists**. This snapshot is now "stale" from the perspective of being 
         associated with a running instance or existing volume.

8.  **Test the Lambda Function Again (After Resources are Stale)**
    *   Go back to your Lambda function's code tab.
    *   Click the **"Test"** button again. You can use the same "test" event.
    *   The function will execute.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The function should now identify the snapshot as stale (because its associated volume is not found or not 
        attached to a running instance) and delete it. The function logs should indicate the deletion.
    *   **Verification:** Go back to the EC2 Snapshots dashboard and **refresh the page**. The "test snapshot" should now be deleted.

9.  **Optional: Set up a CloudWatch Trigger for Automation**
    *   This project demonstrates automating cost optimization. Running the Lambda manually is for testing. For recurring checks (e.g., 
        daily), you'd use a trigger.
    *   Go to the **CloudWatch** service in the AWS console.
    *   Go to **Events** (or EventBridge) -> **Rules**.
    *   Click **"Create rule"**.
    *   Give the rule a name (e.g., "EBS-snapshots-rule").
    *   Under "Event Source", select **"Schedule"**.
    *   Choose **"Cron-based schedule"**. Enter a cron expression to define how often you want the Lambda to run (e.g., `0 10 * * ? *` 
        for 10:00 AM UTC every day).
    *   Under "Targets", click **"Add target"**.
    *   Select **"Lambda function"** from the dropdown.
    *   Select the name of your Lambda function ("cost optimization EBS snapshot").
    *   Click **"Configure details"** (or Next).
    *   Review the rule details and click **"Create rule"**.
    *   **Note:** Be mindful of the cost if you set up recurring triggers and forget about them, as the Lambda function will continue to 
        execute.

By following these steps, you replicate the demonstration of using Boto3 within a Python Lambda function, triggered either manually or by CloudWatch, to automate a crucial DevOps task: identifying and deleting stale resources for cloud cost optimization. The code logic specifically targets snapshots based on whether their associated volume exists or is attached to a running instance.
